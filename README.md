PyFin is a tool which helps individuals decide how to split their retirement savings given South African tax rates. It considers how much money is already in those accounts, how future savings can be allocated, and how they grow and are taxed now and at withdrawal. It then devises a plan that will maximise a person's mean income after tax during retirement. 

The output of PyFin is a report with a possible allocation plan for the rest of this tax year. It also provides the projections into the future.
